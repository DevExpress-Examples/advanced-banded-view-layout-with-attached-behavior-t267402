# Advanced Banded View Layout with attached behavior


<p><strong>Update:</strong><br /><em>Starting with version 13.1, we implemented banded grid support out of the box. See the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/CustomDocument15660">Using Bands to Create Multi-Row Layout</a> article and the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E4625">E4625 - How to: Create a Banded View</a> example for more information. The solution below applies to versions prior to 13.1.</em><br /><br />This example demonstrates how to create the banded view for the DXGrid with the attached behavior.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T267411">T267411 - Advanced Banded View Layout with attached behavior</a> for more information.</p>
<p>We have included this solution in the DevExpress.Xpf.Grid.v11.2.Extensions library shipped with the 11.2 major version. Refer to the GridDemo.BandedView demo module to see this feature in action.</p>
